### *`Quartix`*
#### *Borrow-checked mind*

<ins>My thoughts are under strict control:</ins> <br> Every idea is borrowed and returned with precision, eliminating<br> dangling pointers and memory leaks in my mental model.<br><br>

Like a fine-tuned Unix system, the mind runs at minimal cost, running<br> ideas through the filters of logic and reason while background<br> daemons sort out the routine.<br><br>

My repositories are a collection of scripts and tools, each a cog in the<br> mechanism, keeping random thoughts from dissolving into void.<br><br>
  
Telegram: `@Quartix` â€” if you can get through the event horizon of my ignores.<br><br>
I inhabit a black hole singularity where time stretches endlessly in paradoxical<br> generosity, but my deadlines still drown in the abyss of procrastination.

My code is like a set of Unix utilities: each does one thing and does it well.<br> Well, or doesn't do it - that's what debugging is for.
